## I Have a Boba Addiction :)

I'm obsessed with boba, and I buy it weekly, sometimes daily. I figured I would share my thoughts on the boba shops I've tried.


### The Rank

My considerations: 
1. Tea-to-milk ratio
2. Options for sweetness level and ice level
3. Tea quality (i.e. smooth or powdery)
4. Boba quality (chewy, warm, flavor)
5. Menu variety

### Make Your Own Tier List!
I used [this template](https://tiermaker.com/create/boba-tier-list-cerritos-artesia-41255) which already has some shops to rank, but I added a few more to mine.
It looks like this!
